## 1. Why do deep neural networks suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients, and how can they be mitigated?

While training an RNN, your slope can become either too small or too large; this makes the training difficult. When the slope is too small, the problem is known as a **Vanishing Gradient**. When the slope tends to grow exponentially instead of decaying, itâ€™s referred to as an **Exploding Gradient**. Gradient problems lead to long training times, poor performance, and low accuracy.

### **Mitigation Techniques:**
- **Proper Weight Initialization:** Use **Xavier (Glorot) initialization** for sigmoid/tanh activations and **He initialization** for ReLU.
- **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes activations to stabilize training.
- **Gradient Clipping:** Limits the maximum gradient norm to prevent explosion.
- **Use Activation Functions Carefully:** ReLU and variants like LeakyReLU help mitigate vanishing gradients.

---

## 2. How does batch normalization improve deep neural network training?

**Batch Normalization (BN)** normalizes activations across mini-batches, improving convergence and reducing dependency on initialization.

### **Advantages:**
- âœ… **Speeds up training**: Reduces internal covariate shift, leading to faster convergence.
- âœ… **Allows higher learning rates**: Since activations remain stable, larger learning rates can be used.
- âœ… **Acts as a regularizer**: Reduces overfitting similar to dropout by introducing noise from batch statistics.
- âœ… **Improves gradient flow**: Prevents vanishing gradients by keeping mean and variance stable.

#### **Formula:**
```math
\hat{x} = \frac{x - \mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \epsilon}}
```
```math
y = \gamma \hat{x} + \beta
```
Where \( \mu \) and \( \sigma^2 \) are batch mean and variance, and \( \gamma, \beta \) are trainable parameters.

## 3. What is the significance of the Transformer architecture over traditional RNNs and LSTMs?

Transformers replaced RNNs and LSTMs in NLP by introducing **self-attention mechanisms**, solving long-range dependency issues.

### **Key Differences:**
| Feature | RNNs / LSTMs | Transformers |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Processing | Sequential | Parallel |
| Dependency Handling | Poor for long sequences | Captures long-range dependencies well |
| Training Speed | Slow | Faster due to parallelism |

#### **Attention Mechanism Formula:**
```math
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax} \left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
```
Where \( Q, K, V \) are query, key, and value matrices, and \( d_k \) is the dimensionality of keys.

---

## 4. What are GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), and how do they work?

GANs consist of two networks:
- **Generator (G)**: Learns to generate realistic data from random noise.
- **Discriminator (D)**: Classifies real vs. generated data.

#### **Training Process:**
1. **Generator** creates fake samples.
2. **Discriminator** tries to distinguish real vs. fake samples.
3. **Loss Computation (Adversarial Training):**
```math
L = \log(D(x)) + \log(1 - D(G(z)))
```

---

## 5. How does the BERT model understand context better than traditional word embeddings like Word2Vec?

Unlike **Word2Vec**, which produces **static embeddings**, BERT generates **contextualized embeddings** using **self-attention**.

| Feature | Word2Vec | BERT |
|---------|---------|------|
| Context | Static | Dynamic |
| Attention | No | Yes |
| Training | Word Co-occurrence | Transformer-Based |

BERT uses **Masked Language Modeling (MLM)** to learn deep bidirectional representations.

---

## 6. Explain the concept of Knowledge Distillation in deep learning.

Knowledge Distillation is a technique where a **large model (Teacher)** transfers knowledge to a **smaller model (Student)**.

### **Loss Function:**
```math
L_{distill} = (1 - \alpha) H(y, s) + \alpha KL(\sigma(t/\tau), \sigma(s/\tau))
```
Where:
- \( H \) = cross-entropy loss
- \( KL \) = KL-divergence
- \( t, s \) = logits from teacher and student
- \( \tau \) = temperature parameter

âœ… Used in **DistilBERT, TinyML, Efficient models**.
